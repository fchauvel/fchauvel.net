I basically like coding and I am lucky enough to get the opportunity
to develop open source software as part of my job. Below are the
application that I developed:

 * [__MAD__](https://pythonhosted.org/MAD/) is a simulator of
   self-adaptive software architectures. MAD captures the interplay of
   so-called 'defencive' mechanisms (e.g., queues, AQM, auto-scaling,
   timeouts, back-off, ...). MAD runs discrete events simulation and
   estimates performances including reliability, availability and
   response time to name a few.

 * [__TRIO__](https://github.com/fchauvel/trio) quantifies the
   robustness of software architectures. The evaluation algorithm
   borrows from Biology the idea of 'extinction sequences'. Given a
   model of the architecture that captures the dependencies between
   components, it also spots the weakest point as well as the most
   dangerous sequences of failures.

 * [__FLaP__](https://pythonhosted.org/FLaP/) is a small Python script
   that generates a 'flat' version of LaTeX projects that include
   multiple source files.

I also contributed to other open source projects, such as the Kermeta
language and the CloudML tool.
