I like coding and I am lucky enough to get the opportunity to develop
open source software as part of my job. I have been involved in
development of the tools including:

-   [__CAMP__](https://STAMP-project.github.io/camp) helps you amplify
    your configuration tests. Given your docker resources, CAMP will
    run your tests in multiple environments, giving you confidence!

-   [__CloudML__](https://cloudml.org) helps you deploys your
    application accross multiple clouds, such as AWS, Azure, etc.

Below are the
applications that I developed on my own:

 * [__RPP__](https://fchauvel.github.io/rpp) is NodeJS application
   which lets you makes projects plans from minimal textual
   descriptions.

 * [__quick-check__](https://fchauvel.github.io/quick-check/index.html)
   is Javascript library to declare data schema. I remove boiler plate
   codes that validates and convert data into custom classes.

 * [__MAD__](https://pythonhosted.org/MAD/) is a simulator of
   self-adaptive software architectures. MAD captures the interplay of
   so-called 'defencive' mechanisms (e.g., queues, AQM, auto-scaling,
   timeouts, back-off, ...). MAD runs discrete events simulation and
   estimates performances including reliability, availability and
   response time to name a few.

 * [__FLaP__](https://pythonhosted.org/FLaP/) is a small Python script
   that generates a 'flat' version of LaTeX projects that include
   multiple source files.

 * [__TRIO__](https://github.com/fchauvel/trio) quantifies the
   robustness of software architectures. The evaluation algorithm
   borrows from Biology the idea of 'extinction sequences'. Given a
   model of the architecture that captures the dependencies between
   components, it also spots the weakest point as well as the most
   dangerous sequences of failures.
