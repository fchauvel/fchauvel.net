<!-- hook: Why should you read this page -->

Use cases? Uh ... isn't it one of those UML diagrams with stickmen,
boxes, and bubbles? There is more to it, and "Writing Effective
Use-cases" by A. Cockburn is the place to start.

<!--
    1. How did I come accross it?
    2. Why did I choose it!
-->

I am always unsure about how much requirement I need, especially when
building prototypes? So, reading about use-cases, I came across it on
[M. Fowler's post on his "Use
Cases"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UseCase.html). It still costs
about [30 EUR on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Effective-Cases-Alistair-Cockburn/dp/0201702258),
but I went for it anyway. Several years ago, I had read [Software
Requirements by
K. Wiegers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18350357-software-requirements-3),
I felt I needed a refresher.

<!-- Brief Summary -->

Here come 300 pages on use-cases only. Part I details the various
sections they include, whereas Part II discusses frequently asked
questions. Part III concludes with a list of "reminders for the
busy". UML diagrams only show up in appendix.

<!-- Who is the author(s), when did she/they wrote the book -->

[A. Cockburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn) is
another contributor to the Agile Manifesto and created the Crystal
family of agile methodology. He authored several books on both
use-cases and agile methods.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her/his argument -->

I found this book very practical as it focuses on textual use-cases as
opposed to graphical views as in UML, for instance. We dive straight
in with the use case document and its different sections: Scope, main
scenario, extensions, etc. Alistair helps with the writing style and
provides two templates for the so-called casual and fully-dressed
formats. On the downside, I feel the process to collect and refine
use-cases is somewhat less clear, but I am guessing this goes beyond
the intended scope.

<!-- Rating and Recommendation: Who should read it -->

I finally give it 3 stars. It is a good and practical book and a
reference I will definitely keep in mind. On the downside, I still
do not get how far to go with the requirements.
