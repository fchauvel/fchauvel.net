<!-- hook -->

If just like me, you lost faith in models and model-driven
engineering (MDE) a long time ago, this book might help. It shows how
to reconcile architecture and modelling with agility and maintaining
real software.

<!-- Brief Summary -->

*Just enough software architecture* advocates modelling software until
we feel confident enough to proceed with writing code. That is, if
some technical risks (availability, maintainability, etc.) are not yet
under control, then we should (re-)think how architectural decisions
that could help. G. Fairbanks answers many questions: Which models to
use? For what purpose? What to model, and to what extent? And, how to
reduce the *model-code gap*?

<!-- Who is the author, when did he wrote the book -->

[George Fairbanks](https://www.georgefairbanks.com/) has strong
credentials. He holds a PhD in Software engineering (Carnegie Mellon
University) and has been involved both with Industry and
Academia. George focuses on software architecture and software
engineering in general. He joins (and speaks something) at both
academics and industrial event on software architecture.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her argument -->

*Just enough software architecture* covers a lot of ground. The first
part describes how to risk-drive software architecture. It introduces
software architecture and explains how this helps mitigate technical
risks such as high availability, maintainability, portability and
other "ilities". Tradeoffs are critical here because many of these
quality attributes inherently conflict with one another. Part II
focuses on how to model software architecture and overviews its core
concepts, such as components, connectors, views, constraints,
relationships, patterns, styles, etc. Besides, the various references
to books and academic articles give an interesting historical
perspective.


<!-- Recommendation: Who should read it -->

It is several years since I had read anything about modelling and
software architecture. I think this book is an excellent entry. I
like the writing style, and I find the examples relevant without being
overly complicated. I definitely recommend it to beginners: It's full
of pointers and covers a broad range of topics.

But seasoned architects might also like it. I like George nuanced
approach to modelling (and BDUF), as opposed to agile. His risk-driven
idea makes it problem-specific. I do not model for the sake of it, and
I am regularly punished for jumping at my keyboard too eagerly.

I also like the discussion of the *model-code gap*: Some insights and
architectural decisions (especially rationales) cannot show up in the
code. While the advocated architecture-in-code idea seems a step
forward, it only partially addresses this gap. I am curious to see
what other solutions have been tried and tested.

<!-- Rating -->

Eventually, I give it 3.5 stars. I think it is an accurate introduction
to software architecture, in practice, but, even though I am not an
expert, there was a lot I already knew.
