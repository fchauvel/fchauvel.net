<!-- hook: Why should you read this page -->

Why should you read about Software architecture? Who even cares in
these Agile and DevOps times. Should you, for whatever reason, still
be interested, this book is a good place to approach software
architecture from its theory side.

<!--
    1. How did I come accross it?
    2. Why did I choose it!
-->

Here comes a book I had on my reading list for decades: *Software
Architecture in Practice*, by L. Bass, P. Clements, and R. Kazman. I
should have read this one when I was a PhD student, but I guess I was
too lazy by then. Having recently enjoyed [*Just enough software
architecture*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9005772-just-enough-software-architecture)
and [*Clean
Architecture*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture),
I took it upon myself and gave it a try, despite its price: [EUR 24 on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Software-Architecture-Practice-Architect-Practice_c3-ebook).

<!-- Brief Summary -->

Ready for 650 pages about software architecture? Let's go. Part I sets
up key concepts: What it is, why it matters,
and where it shows up. Part II dives into the many quality
attributes (e.g., availability, modifiability, performances) that
shape software architecture, whereas Part III explains how software
architecture fits into development processes for larger and&mdash;
less convincingly&mdash; smaller teams. Part IV looks at the context
and discusses product-lines and economic concerns before Part V opens
up on two new technologies: Cloud and crowdsourcing.

<!-- Who is the author(s), when did she/they wrote the book -->

I believe this is the reference textbook in the field. The three
authors (Len Bass, Paul Clements and Rick Kazman) are all leading
researchers in Software Architecture. I know some of their work though
I never worked directly on this.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her/his argument -->

I see it as a tour of software architecture: It is comprehensive and
contains a load of references to research articles. The only thing I
did not find is a chapter for developers, dealing with modules,
dependencies, code layouts, etc. Something like day-to-day software
architecture for the lay programmer. Conversely, I found it shallow on
several topics, such as development processes and product-lines to name a
few.

Overall it felt drawn-out and irrelevant. It focuses on "heavy
processes" and targets larger systems with multiple teams distributed
over the globe. I liked best the discussion of quality attributes and
what patterns/styles/tactics help enforce them (cf. Part II). This I
can use.


<!-- Rating and Recommendation: Who should read it -->

I think it deserves its status of the reference textbook. I would
recommend it m master students or to those building a course. I would
not recommend it to programmers though, except for those longing to
architect the largest systems. To my fellow programmers, I recommend
[*Clean architecture* by
R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18043011-clean-architecture)
or [*Just enough software architecture* by
G. Fairbanks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9005772-just-enough-software-architecture). I
also found [*Software architecture for developers* by
S. Brown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33221518-software-architecture-for-developers),
but I haven't read it, yet.
