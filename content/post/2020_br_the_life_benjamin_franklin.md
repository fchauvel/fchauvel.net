<!-- hook -->

We all know Benjamin Franklin &mdash; even I knew his name and
inventions. But do you know the person he was, how he lived and who he
aimed at?

<!-- summary -->

This one was initially published in 1817 and was digitized the Google
Book Search program. The original title is a bit of a mouthful: "The
Life of Benjamin Franklin, written chiefly by himself, with a
collection of his essays, humorous, moral and litterary." The text is
attributed to [Mason
L. Weems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Locke_Weems) (1759
&ndash; 1825), although the first part is written by Franklin himself.

<!-- Evaluation How does the author her argument How does she
structure her argument -->

I was disappointed because this autobiography is only the first 80
pages. There a note says: “The life of Dr Franklin, as written by
himself, breaks off in this place. The following continuation is by
one of his friends.” Follows another 120 pages, and then 60 pages or
so are letters and essays on various topics. I liked the first part
(written by Franklin himself). I found it easy to read despite the
century that went by and written lively. I liked less the second part,
which I found confusing: It mixes letters, narratives,
etc. Eventually, it still gives an overview of Franklin’s life and
achievements.

<!-- Recommendation -->

I have not read other biographies of Franklin, so I can only give a
biased opinion, but I would not recommend it, except for those who
like old and free books. I understand from the [Wikipedia page on
B. Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) that
Franklin wrote others parts of his life, but those were found later
on, and recent autobiographies may be less disappointing.

<!-- Rating -->

Eventually, I give it two stars. It does not sound
like an autobiography. It is more of a biography filled with letters
and essays.
