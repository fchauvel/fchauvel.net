I am often disappointed by my daily organisation: I discard many of my
projects, and most of them do not live to my expectations. One thing
that especially bugs me is to fail making progress on multiple
projects at the same time. I am diving into one particular project
and, when I emerge two weeks later, every other things have gone
bad. This is especially true for development tasks, where I get bogged
down, consistently. Below is my strategy ...

Here is my idea: combine a Kanban board with reactive planning! I
refined this over the years, and it seems to work for me. I picked
ideas various sources including David Allen's *Getting Things Done*
(GTD) approach [Allen 2001] and Lean approaches especially Kanban
boards Tto do" column as an [Eisenhower
matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method). This
matrix position tasks according to both their urgency and their
importance. It help me identify quickly the important and urgent,
which I must process as soon as possible. These appears obviously in
the top-right corner.


## Projects' Diary

Another habit I developed is to create a diary for each project I
engage in. Such diaries includes a project summary and a diary per
se. The summary is just a brief statement of the what would be a
successful outcome, possibly completed by a timeline. The diary simply
collect the ideas and thoughts I have when working on the related
tasks.

When I complete a task, I open the project diary and quickly check the
relevance of both the objectives and timeline, and adjust them as
necessary. Then I review the diary and decide on the next action that
will get me closer to my objectives.


## Take Aways

Here lies how I managed to get more effective and avoid
procrastination&mdash;at least some. As I write, I realise that the
Kanban board itself is probably overkill: the Eisenhower matrix is
really the tool that helps me quickly decide on which task to engage
next. I will let you know if I changing my board works as well.
