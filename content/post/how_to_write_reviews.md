As a researcher, I submit articles, and I received
reviews, consequently. Of course, I do not like to receive negative
comments, but. As I am also a reviewer, here some ideas that help me
improve my reviews.

## What to Say?

### First, the substance

 * Is it useful? Can we do something with the present result.

 * Is it true, like are the claims backed by facts or experiment, whose interpretation is sound

 * Is it new?

 * Is it relevant for the venue?


### Only then, the form

 * How does it flow? 
 
 * What is missing?
 
 * What about illustration? Too many, not enough?
 
 * Is it written in good English? Style?
 
 * Typos?


### Review Templates

For several years now, I collect questions and issues I found into a detailed
*template*. This template varies with both the venue (journals,
conference proceedings, workshops) and the type of article (technical
contributions, surveys, and position papers).

 * Template for technical contributions 
 * Template for surveys
 * Template for vision papers

## How to Say it?

received quite some rebuttals!
