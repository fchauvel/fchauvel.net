+++

As a researcher, I submit research articles for peer-review. The
reviews I get are unfortunately *too often deceptive*&mdash;not only
because most are rebuttals. These reviews are of very little use,
beyond improving my broken English.

Below are the key points I wish reviewers would discuss. As a matter
of fact, I do also consider them when I write reviews. While I am
aware of the time it takes to write a detailed review, I am convinced
that it does help moving research in the right direction.


## First, the "Science"

### Are my Objectives Clear?

First, I would like to know if the problem I tackle, and if my motivations
make sense.

 1. *Do you understand the problem?* I often spend times crafting an
    introduction that explains my problem, and why existing approaches
    are not sufficient.
 
 2. *Do you understand why I am doing this?* I also strive to explain
    why solving this problem matters, and how solution may in turn,
    contribute to larger or even societal challenges?
 
 3. *Do you think it is worth?* Should you disagree with the benefits I
    foresee, please explain me what you disagree with.
	
 4. *Have you grasped the general idea?* Eventually, I hope you
    understand how the big pieces fit together.
	
### Is it Really New?

Knowing the state-of-the-Art is hard, so next comes the question of
*novelty*. I do my best to survey and understand existing literature,
and yet, I will always overlook some references, especially in other
fields.

 1. *Do you know anything similar?* My idea may not be as new as I
    think, and other may have already experiment with it. I found it
    very difficult to spot articles from other fields that uses a
    completely different parlance. If you do, please give me one exact
    reference.
    	
 2. *Do you know anything equivalent?* It may be as well that others
    already had different and maybe better ideas, but I haven't
    stumbled upon. If you know some, please let me know.
	
 3. *Is this a sufficient increment?* From time to time, I extend
    some previous publications. While I roughly target 50&nbsp;% of new
    material, this remains a matter of interpretation.

### The Magic

OK, now we have got the problem, the motivation and the overall approach,
let's dive into the details.

 1. *Is it correct?* In other words, does it address the problem I
    described. I try my best, but there may always be cases I have not
    thought of.
	
 2. *Would you have done it the same way?* Maybe you are thinking of a
    better idea, or you would have tried something else?


### Would you Buy it?

My next questions concerns the *evaluation*, that is how what I
propose solves the problem. Depending on the state-of-the-Art and how
mature is my research, I may make three different claims:

  1. *It is possible!* It may sound naive, but not every idea is
  practical&mdash;at least not all my ideas. Building a prototype that
  implements my solution is the first step.
 
  2. *It works!* My prototype is operational, but, it must also solve
  problems, from toy examples to real-life case-studies, ideally.
 
  3. *It is better!* My solution works but it must also costs
  reasonable resources (time, memory, etc.), and ideally outperform
  its competitors.
  
So, will you buy any of these? I guess it depends on the experiments I
describe to support them. For each, I wish to know:

 1. *Is it the right experiment?* Do you agree that my experiment
    tests one of these claims, or did I get confused and am I testing
    something slightly different. Maybe you would have come up with a
    different experiment?
	
 2. *Do you see any bias?* Am I making any additional assumptions in
    my experiment that reduce its applicability?
    
 2. *Could you reproduce it?* Ideally, I should provide enough material for
    you to reproduce my experiment. Do you feel confident you have
    enough details and material available?
  
These experiments are just a means to produce the data that eventually
confirm or disprove my claims.

 1. *Would you draw the same conclusions?* It is difficult to be
    completely objective in how we interpret the data. Do you reach
    the same conclusions as I?

 2. *Is it statistically convincing?* Depending on the type of
    experiment, I may use statistics quantify evidence&mdash;not
    necessarily to mislead you I promise. Do think it helps? Would you
    have presented other numbers?
 
 1. *Should more data be available?* If my experiment seems difficult
    to reproduce, would you like to see additional data available.


## Only then, the form

If you still have time and energy, I appreciate it. Now, I would like
be happy to know how you feel about the text.

### The Flow

 1. *Is it clear?* Did you spend 5 hours reading again and again the
    same single paragraph to eventually gave up? What did you miss to
    understand? Are there some magical steps? Is there too little or
    too much information?

 2. *Is the flow coherent?* Did you have to go back and forth while
    reading the paper or did I manage to the right information in the
    right place?

 3. *Is it self-contained?* Did you miss something or did you have to
    read additional resources to understand?
	
 4. *Diagrams, Tables and charts?* Did you find them useful or
    useless? Maybe some text would better be a chart or diagram.
	

### Style and Typos?

You are still there, so I must thank you for your effort. So here are
my last two questions, the style and the grammar.

 1. *The style?* Did you find that the text reads well? Are sentences
    clumsy, too long. Maybe you have found the text too academic or,
    at the opposite, too colloquial.
	
 2. *Any Grammar or Spelling mistake?* I know myself, and there must
    be spelling mistakes and typos lurking here and there. Thank you
    for pointing the ones you spotted.
	

All your comments will help me rework my articles and hopefully we
shall together save some time for my next reviewers.
