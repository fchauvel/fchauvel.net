I was very surprised with this book, whose title hooked me, since I am
also a failure in saie &mdash; though I sell ideas more than
products. I had never thought I would ever read anything about
"selling".  Surprisingly, I found the text very relevant and his
advices applicable. For instance, dealing with objections using
questions (the [Socratic
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)) worked quite
well for me. Same with selling interviews instead of
products. F. Bettger backup his ideas with anecdotes from his life
that show, at least, how these tricks worked for him.

<!-- Recommendation --> I would definitely recommend it to anyone
whose new to selling, regardless of what you sell. I went easily
though the text, and I found these stories rather entertaining. If you
are already an expert in sale, F. Bettger recommends ["Secrets of
closing sales", by
C. B. Roth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4517696-secrets-of-closing-sales). Following
another of his suggestion, I went on to read the [autobiography of
Benjamin Franklin]().

<!-- Rating -->

At the end, I gave it 3 star: I like it and I am glad I read it. I am
left with the feeling that, it may not make a difference though, since
selling is a small part of wat I do.
