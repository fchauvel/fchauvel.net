Are you lost in the jungle of (big-)data technologies?  Are you wondering
how the Flink, Spark, Hive, Pig, Airflow and the likes fit together?
Then this is the right book!

<!-- How did I come accross it? -->

I found it as a recommendation on
[Goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com). I wanted to learn about data
technologies as I work more and more on this and I felt it was a good
match: It was recent enough (2017), and was available on [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Martin_Kleppmann_Designing_Data_Intensive_Applicat?id=p1heDgAAQBAJ)
within my budget (EUR 12).

<!-- Brief Summary -->

In 616 pages, it covers a lot of ground, through three parts. Part I
lays some foundations: It defines reliability, scalability,
maintainability, data models, query languages and storage
engines. Part II explores data distribution and covers replication,
partitioning/sharding, transaction, consistency and consensus. Part
III focuses on data processing and discuss batch processing and stream
processing.

<!-- Who is the author, when did he wrote the book -->

[Martin Kleppmann](http://martin.kleppmann.com/) is a researcher at
 Cambridge University, who [focuses on
 data](https://dblp.org/pid/148/2880.html). He has also
 been an entrepreneur and speaks at conferences regularly.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her/his argument -->

I enjoyed the read: Despite a very technical subject, I liked the way
Martin explains complicated issues with simple diagrams and intuitive
ideas. No greek symbols, no pedantic sentences. Yet, the book is full
of pointers to both research articles, blog posts for those who would
like to dig deeper. Each chapter starts with a map&mdash;you know,
those maps of imaginary worlds we found in fantasy books or
role-playing games. Here, those maps relate all the data concepts and
technologies and taught me a lot! I saw connections I had never
thought of. Overall, I feel I learned a lot, and at the end, Martin
discusses ethical issues with data and machine-learning that made me
think&mdash;I am still thinking.

<!-- Rating and Recommendation: Who should read it -->

I give it four stars! I definitely recommend it to those who want
to enter the world of data-intensive systems. I am also convinced that
the sheer number of pointers makes it an interesting reference for
experts!  Next, we have to choose a specific technology to dive
deeper. Martin gave us the map, we just have to follow our interest!
