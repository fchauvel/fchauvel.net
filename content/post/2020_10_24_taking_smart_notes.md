    1. How did I come accross it?
    2. Why did I choose it!
-->

Yet another book that [Goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com)
recommended. I always felt my notes taking is inadequate: In meetings,
I often note only the irrelevant. But this is not about writing
meeting minutes. It is about taking generating ideas by taking notes
while reading&mdash;as the subtitle says. Good match anyway, since I
am also doing research.

As a tight-fisted person, I looked at the price first, and then the
age and relevance. It was recent enough (2017), available on [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/S%C3%B6nke_Ahrens_How_to_Take_Smart_Notes)
within my budget (EUR 7.5), and relevant.

<!-- Brief Summary -->

It tells about one technique: The *slip-box*
([Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) in
German). You write one note per idea, number every note,
and link every note to others. As you read, you gradually create a
graph of knowledge that helps generate insights. This book details how
to get that rolling in three parts: It starts with an overview of the
slip-box, then proposes four core principles, and finally lists six
steps to successful writing.


<!-- Who is the author, when did he wrote the book -->

[Sönke Ahrens](https://takesmartnotes.com/about/), the author, is a
researcher in Education and Social Sciences. But the slip-box is not
his creation. He attributes it to [Niklas
Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), a very
successful German philosopher, sociologist and social scientist, whose
success is attributed to his zettelkasten.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her/his argument -->

I went easily through the 180 pages. I liked the many references to
psychology that explain well why research and ideation
difficult. Besides, S. Ahrens makes a strong case against planning and
advocates instead to let the work carry us forward. Like him, I
eventually dropped productivity methods like
[GTD](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done) or
[Kanban](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10419045-personal-kanban),
but without finding a satisfactory alternative. On the downside, I
would not reduce Luhmann's success to his slip-box&mdash;though I had
never heard of before. I think there is something else to success,
otherwise, everyone with a slip-box would have written dozen of
volumes.

<!-- Rating and Recommendation: Who should read it -->

I still give it three stars. Only time will say, but I like the
general idea and I am now using [a digital
slip-box](https://obsidian.md/). Externalizing my notes helps me
re-engage with them on a daily basis: A big improvement. As a next
step, I am looking at other books about how we think and get
ideas. What about [Thinking fast and
slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow)?
