book by D. Carnegie might be for you.

<!-- Brief Summary -->

D. Carnegie proposes a catalogue of tips and tricks to better deal
with people, including how to make people like you, how to win people
to your way of thinking and, how to be a leader. These range from very
simple things like smiling, to more skilful techniques such as asking
questions instead of arguing (the Socratic method).

<!-- Who is the author, when did he wrote the book -->

[Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie) (1888
&ndash; 1955) pioneered "self-help", and this book, published in 1936,
is one of the first in the genre, and ever since a best
seller. D. Carnegie had an early interest in public speaking and
started selling various things, from correspondence courses, soap and
lard. He then tried acting, before he succeeded in teaching public
speaking and self-confidence.

<!-- Evaluation: How does she structure her argument -->

This is a catalogue where each chapter is short, self-contained and
focuses on one technique. Each technique is illustrated and backed-up
by stories of Carnegie's former students, who eventually succeed and,
arguably, saw changes in their life or career. While Dale's arguments
make sense and these stories entertained, I missed stronger
evidence. I like however the catalogue format because it makes it easy
to come back to specific techniques. Eventually, all this smiling,
praising, avoiding arguments, getting people to talk about their
interests, avoiding criticism, etc. sounded to me like being
manipulative and insincere. Can we do all this sincerely?.

<!-- Recommendation -->

Soft skills are not my strong suit and I am left with the impression
that is is an easy read (and win) for the ignorants&mdash;like me. I
would not recommend it to the pros.

<!-- Rating -->

Finally, I give this book three stars. I went through easily without
self-flagellation and even noted down some techniques, but I
eventually moved on to other things.
