## Research Interests

I am a software engineer who ended up doing applied research. My
interests therefore revolve about programmin, software engineering,
and artificial intelligence.

 * __Complex Adaptive Systems__ fascinates me, especially distributed
   ones. I observe that as software systems grow in both in size and
   complexity and include more AI, they resemble complex adaptive
   systems, whose behaviour is difficult to understand, let alone to
   predict.

 * __Agile Software Development__ and the software craftsmanship ideas
   struck me as obvious once we know them. I am very interested in how
   these ideas apply and foster scientific research, which is highly
   iterative in nature.

 * __Software Architecture__ is, in my opinion, the art of mixing in a
   pot various technologies and obtaining a coherent, maintainable
   and scalable whole.


## International Research Projects

I have been lucky enough to join several international research
projects and I am grateful for the competences I learnt from my
colleagues, including programming, software architecture, mathematics,
project management, etc.


 * __[ENACT (2007 &ndash; 2021)](https://www.enact-project.eu/)__
   develops tools and methods to systematically support DevOps for
   trustworthy smart IoT systems. I contributed to
   [GeneSIS](https://enact.gitlab.io/GeneSIS/#/), the ENACT tool to
   automate deployment and monitoring.

 * __[STAMP (2016 &ndash; 2019)](https://www.stamp-project.eu/)__
   stands for Software Testing AMPlification. Leveraging advanced
   research in automatic test generation, STAMP aims at pushing
   automation in DevOps one step further through innovative methods of
   test amplification. I developed
   [CAMP](https://STAMP-project.github.io/camp), a tool to automate
   configuration testing.

 * __[ARCADIA (2014&ndash;2017)](http://www.arcadia-framework.eu)__
   explores the development oh "highly distributed applications" (HDA),
   which it searches to optimally deploy and configure.

 * __[DREAMS
   (2013&ndash;2017)](https://www.uni-siegen.de/dreams/home/)__
   addresses the design of mixed-criticality systems, that is systems
   where functions with varying criticality execute on the same chip.

 * __[DIVERSIFY (2013&ndash;2016)](http://diversify-project.eu)__
   explores synergies between Ecology and Software Engineering. We
   developed novel techniques to 'diversify' software systems at the
   architecture and code level, and in turn, increase robustness,
   security and other extra-functional properties.

 * __[MODAClouds (2013&ndash;2016)](http://modaclouds.eu)__ tackles
   the interoperability issue between IaaS and PaaS providers. We
   developed [CloudML](http://cloudml.org) to maintain architecture
   diagrams in synchrony with the running system.

 * __[REMICS (2010&ndash;2013)](http://www.remics.eu/)__ studied the
   migration of legacy service-oriented application to the Cloud,
   using model-driven engineering techniques.

 * __[CONNECT (2008&ndash;2012)](https://www.connect-forever.eu/)__
   explores interoperability solutions to automatically generate
   connectors between software pieces.

## National Research Projects

 * __CIRRUS (2015&ndash;2019)__ focuses on the customisation of
   cloud-based solution, initially designed for 'on-premises'
   execution. The aim is to build a Cloud-based multi-tenant platform,
   open for customisation.

 * __[SysLife
   (2011&ndash;2013)](https://www.sintef.no/en/projects/syslife-system-for-tilstands-og-levetidsrelaterte-/)__
   analyse maintenance information in order to better estimate the
   remaining lifetime and failure probability of components in power
   systems.

 * __FAROS (2005&ndash;2008)__ studied how to compose software
   components using 'contracts' and model-driven technologies.
