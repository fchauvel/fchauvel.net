I am researching into the field of design and implementation of
self-adaptive systems. My current research objective is to
detect&mdash;at design-time&mdash;performances issues due to
interactions between feedback loops, using simulation of architectural
models.

I am currently working as a research scientist in [SINTEF
ICT](https://www.sintef.no/en/information-and-communication-technology-ict/about-sintef-ict/#OURDepartments)
where I joined the [MOD group](http://modelbased.net/). Our activities
focus on model-driven engineering applied to various areas such as
Embedded Systems, Service Engineering, Scientific computing. I
contributed to several international research projects, such as the
FP7 projects [MODAClouds](http://www.modaclouds.eu/),
[DIVERSIFY](http://diversify-project.eu/) or
[DREAMS](https://www.uni-siegen.de/dreams/home/) as well as Norwegian
national projects such as CIRRUS.

Formerly, I spent almost 2 years, in Beijing (China), where I joined
the SAM group (Software Architecture and Middleware Group) of [SEI in
the Peking
University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/Schools_Departments/). I hold a
Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of South Brittany
(France) in 2008, and a Master Degree in Computer Science from the
University of Rennes 1 (France) in 2003.
