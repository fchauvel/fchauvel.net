*Hi, I'm Franck!* I have always been passionate about writing
software. While I started as a programmer (BS and MS in Computer
Science), my need to learn and explore led me to research more than 15
years ago. My enthusiasm and curiosity turned me into a "Swiss knife":
Not only do I help design, manage, sell research & innovation projects
in Software Engineering, but I also write code! I have joined numerous
national and international research projects and occupied various
roles (engineer, work package leader, coordinator) and keep enjoying
working with ever-changing cutting-edge technologies. I have worked
with various technologies (Python, Java, Scala, Javascript and C/C++)
in various application domains including Cloud deployments, CRM
systems and safety-critical systems.


## What am I looking for?

By heart, I am a programmer and I am enthusiastic at the prospect of
playing with new technologies, and to blend them with research ideas
to create better software solutions. As a researcher, I am looking for
better ways to design and implement self-adaptive systems, that is,
systems that automatically adjust to their environment. I am
fascinated by biological that can self-organize and sustain despite a
hostile environment.

## What am I doing?

I am currently a research scientist at [SINTEF
Digital](https://www.sintef.no/digital/) where I joined the [Secure
IoT Software
group](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/software-and-service-innovation/secure-iot-software/). Our
activities focus on novel tools and methods to develop secure software
for the Cloud, Edge and IoT. In SINTEF Digital, I help design, sell,
manage, and implement research and innovation projects in Software
Engineering. I have joined various national (SysLife, CIRRUS) and
European projects (MODAClouds, DIVERSIFY, DREAMS, ARCADIA, STAMP,
ENACT), I have published more than 50 publications in international
peer-reviewed venues and contributed to OASIS TOSCA. Yet, what I enjoy
most is the technical part of research: Building prototypes and
experiments that reveals what would make them more effective.

## What I used to do?

Formerly, I spent almost 2 years, in Beijing (China), where I joined
the SAM group (Software Architecture and Middleware Group) of [SEI in
the Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/Schools_Departments/)
as a post-doctoral fellow. I joined the European [FP7 FET CONNECT
project](https://www.connect-forever.eu/index.html), where I developed
a code-generator that converted the formal specifications of mediators
into deployable OSGi bundles. I published 8 publications in
international peer-reviewed venues.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of South
Brittany (France) since 2008, where I explore tools and methods to
develop self-adaptive software systems. I also hold a Master degree
(MSc) in Computer Science from the University of Rennes 1 (France)
since 2003, and technical bachelor degree (BSc) on Software
Engineering.
