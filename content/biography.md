It is me, the guy who publish this website.

## What am I looking for?

I am a programmer researching for better ways to design and implement
self-adaptive systems, that is systems that automatically adjust to
their environment. I am looking for opportunities to evaluate research
ideas in industrial settings, especially around Cloud technologies.

My current objective is to detect, at design-time, performances issues
due to interactions between feedback loops, using simulation of
architectural models.

## What am I doing?

I am currently 'research scientist' in [SINTEF
ICT](https://www.sintef.no/en/information-and-communication-technology-ict/about-sintef-ict/#OURDepartments)
where I joined the [SSD group](http://modelbased.net/). Our activities
focus on model-driven engineering applied to various areas such as
embedded systems, cloud computing or scientific computing. I
contributed to several international research projects, such as the
FP7 projects [MODAClouds](http://www.modaclouds.eu/),
[DIVERSIFY](http://diversify-project.eu/) or
[DREAMS](https://www.uni-siegen.de/dreams/home/) as well as Norwegian
national projects such as CIRRUS.

## What I used to do?

Formerly, I spent almost 2 years, in Beijing (China), where I joined
the SAM group (Software Architecture and Middleware Group) of [SEI in
the Peking
University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/Schools_Departments/). I hold a
Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of South Brittany
(France) since 2008, and a Master degree in Computer Science from the
University of Rennes 1 (France) since 2003.
